2. `celerybeat-schedule.dat` - ".dat" file extension is a generic data file that stores specific information relating to the program that created the file.
3. `celerybeat-schedule.dir` - A ".dir" file is a movie or animation project created by Adobe Director, an application used to create multimedia games and e-learning courses.
